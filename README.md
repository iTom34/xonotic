# Hi there :wave:

This project is a docker image of Xonotic, a open source FPS game.

## Requirements
If you want to run the game in a docker container you need two files:

- `server.cfg` server configuration file. Find a template in the repository.
- `docker-compose.yml` Docker configuration description. Find a template in the repository

## Run server
To run the server `docker-compose up`
To stop the server `docker-compose down`
To pull the latest version of the container `docker-compose pull`

Enjoy :smiley:

## Contact
If I didn't update the repository with the latest version of Xonotic, feel free to ping me on github :wink:
